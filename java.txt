 *******************************feature of java**************************************************


 1.simple :- java is simple for c and c++ learner ,because  all complexities of C andC++ is reduced in java .  
 2.open source :- java is open source that means source code of java is available for user and user can  modify source.
 3.Platform Independent :- java is Platform Independent that means you can run java program on any operating system.
 4. object oriented :- java programing language is an object oriented programming language.
 5. High performance :- The performance of java programming is better than C anc C++.
 6.Write once run anywhere
 7. Architecture Neutral :- java program is not executed under operating system. java program is executed under java runtimes enviroment (JRE).
 9.multithreaded :- java programming language suppports concept of multithreading.
 10.wed application development :- you can development application by using java programming language.


**********************application developed using java**********************************
1.desktop application e.g media player , anti-virus... etc 
2.wed application e.g irctc.co.in.
3.EPR(Enterprise resource planning) like banking solutoin e.g. finacle.
4.Embedded system and Robotics.
5.Game development.
....

class is blue print of object it is collection of variables and methods.

public is a keyword access modifier.
static is a modifier.
void is a keyword and  return type.
main is method name.
String it is used to take input from command line.
system is class.
out is a object .
println is a method.

how to take input from user in java?
scanner Is class in java for inpur in java we use Scanner class object. Scanner is a class available in java.util packages.
package:- package is a collection of classes, interfaces and sub-package.
Code :- import java.util.Scanner;
Classname objectname = new Classname();
Scanner sc= new Scanner(System.in);
for int  input:- 
int a; 
a =sc.nextInt();

for float input :-
float b;
b= sc.nextFloat();

for double input:-
double b;
b=sc.nextDouble();

for String input :-
String name ;
name =sc.nextLine();

Decision Controls in java :- Decision control are used to decision making.In java programming language there are following types of decision controls:-
1. if statement 
2.if-else statement
3.ladder if else statement
4.switch statement

1.if statement:- it is keyword which work as decision control.We attach a condition with if block code will executed otherwise no code will be executed.

if(condition){
      //code
}
2. if-else statement:- if - else is  the variration of if statement.we attach a condition with  if statement,if given condition is true then if block code will executed and if given condition is false then else block code will executed .
if (condition){
      //code
}else{
      //code
} 

Ternary Operator (?):-Ternary operator is the alternate of if-else,(expression1)?(expression2):(expression3);
if expression1 is true then expression2 will executed and if expression1 is false then expression3 will executed.

ladder if else:- If you have many conditions and you want to execute code based on those conditions,them you can use ladder if-else.

if (condition1){

//code 1 executed

}else if (condition2){

//code2 executed

}else{

//code3 executed

}
(expression1)?(kuch karenge):(kuch aur karenge);

Switch statement :- switch is keyword,which work as a case control.It is used to menu based program. 

switch (expression) //int or char or String
{
      case1:
      //code
      break;
       case2:
      //code
      break;
       case3:
      //code
      break;
      default:
      //code
      
}


About the loop control :- If you have a block of code which you want to execute repeatedly up to given condition is true ,then you can use a loop comtrol .in java programming language there are  four types of loops controls:-

1.while loop 
2.for loop
3. do-while loop 
4. for each loop

1.while loop:- while is a keyword  which works as loop control.
Initialization of loop counter;
while(condition){
      //code
      updation of loop counter
}
